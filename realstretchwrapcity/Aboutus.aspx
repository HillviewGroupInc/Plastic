     <p><b>Note to our Valued Customers:</b> Due to Chinese Imports & their currency manipulation on Petroleum-Based products & Resins used to produce Stretch wrap, 
                    USF has had no choice but to lay off approximately 50% of our commissioned-salaried US sales reps either thru early retirement or on a voluntary basis. 
                    We predict in 2016-17 another 10% of our staff will be dismissed. USF will continue to conduct full-scale operations with a scaled down staff. 
                    However, Any case orders or skid orders of 3 skids or less will now be ordered on this website. Orders of 4 skids or more will continue to be ordered 
                    through your Sales Representative or by calling 561-686-0000. Shipping & Freight will not be affected by this change as we outsource this part of the business. 
                    We will continue to offer you the best prices & best USA-made products & make this economic transition into a Salesperson-Free environment 
                    as seamless as possible for YOU... Our Clients. Thank you for your continued support. We are a Veteran-Owned business and look forward to serving you

                <h3 class="center">Facts You Should Know</h3>
                 <p>The Differences between Blown, Cast, and Pre-stretched Pallet wrap</p>
                    <p>Blown pallet wrap <br />
                        Originally, all pallet wrap was Blown Film and, a process much like blowing a large bubble. 
                            Resin is heated and passed over an opening through which air is blown. 
                            Blown materials are strong and ideally suited for cold room applications.
                        <br />
                        Conventional Blown Pallet wrap characteristics are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hazy, dull in appearance</li>
                            <li>Excellent puncture resistance</li>
                            <li>Very noisy unwind</li>
                            <li>High force on load</li>
                            <li>Cast pallet wrap</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        This is also called Cast Film or Cast Stretch Film and is manufactured using the cast extrusion process. 
                        It is extruded through rollers and “laid out” in sheets. This process allows the film to be made in multiple layers. 
                        The layers allow the film to be made with cling on only one side. This one sided cling film is great in situations where you don’t want 
                        one pallet to stick to the one next to it, these film layers can make the film stronger by adding tough layers to the inside.
